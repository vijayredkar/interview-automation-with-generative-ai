Question one in Japan, what is the difference?
00:00:35
But we linked list and hashmap and when to use which one candidates answer?
00:01:35
Question two and notice what is the purpose of the modular export?

Screening interview this discussion is to evaluate your basic competency level and decide on shortlisting for the next detailed discussion round.
00:01:49
They can you answer only after you have listened to the entire question first.

00:01:58
Answer as clearly and then.
00:02:00
Partly as you can, all the best question one in Java, what is the difference between linkedlist and hash map and when to use which one candidates answer?
00:02:12
A linked list represents A sequential ordering of elements.
00:02:18
Maps are used to represent collection of key and value pairs.
00:02:24
Link list will ensure that elements are not duplicate.
00:02:29
Link linked list can store only string type data whereas HASHMAP has no such restriction.
00:02:48
Question two, and nobody's what is the purpose of the modular exports candidate sensor?
00:02:55
In node JS module encapsulates all related codes into single unit of code that can be passed by moving all relevant functions into a single file.
00:03:10
You may export a module with module and export the.

In a messaging system like after, what is a partition candidates answer.
00:04:08
Partitions allow parallelism in Kafka, allowing for multiple consumers to read and process messages from the same topic simultaneously.
00:04:26
Each partition is ordered and immutable sequence of messages identified by an integer partition number.
00:04:35
Topics are simply logical abstraction that group the related.
00:04:41
Messages together, whereas partitions are.
00:04:45
Physical storage units for those messages.
00:04:56
Question 5 in Spring boot, which annotation will be used if you want to perform the task as soon as the application starts up.
00:05:04
This execution should appropriately once candidates answer.
00:05:09
I think I can use the spring boot application annotation in my main spring boot class.
00:05:16
This annotation will tell Spring boot to wire all the components.
00:05:21
And execute the tasks as mentioned in those classes.
00:05:30
Your interview is now complete.
00:05:33
Thank you for your time and patience.
