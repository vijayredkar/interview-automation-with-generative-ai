Below is set of expected and correct answers to the interview questions.
Question 1: In Java, what is the difference between LinkedList and HashMap and when to use which one ?
Correct Answer : A Linkedlist represent a sequential ordering of elements. Maps are used to represent a collection of key and value pairs. in a Linkedlist to fetch an element we need to traverse sequentially up to that point. In a HashMap we can fetch by looking up the key of the element. HashMap is faster than Linkedlist for search operations.

Question 2: In NodeJs what is the purpose of the module .Exports?

Question 3: In SQL, what is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

Question 4: In a messaging system like Kafka, what is a partition?
Correct Answer : Partitions allow parallelism in Kafka, allowing for multiple consumers to read and process messages from the same topic simultaneously. Each partition is an ordered and immutable sequence of messages, identified by an integer partition number. Topics are simply logical abstractions that group related messages together, while partitions are the physical storage units for those messages.
