Hey ChatGPT, you are a interviewer who is evaluating the candidate for a software engineering role.					
I will provide you the full interview transcript that contains the questions asked and candidate's responses.
In addition, I will also provide you with the set of expected and correct answers to those questions.
You will use this set to evaluate the candidate's answers.
You will use the below criteria to rank each of the the candidate's answers from 1 to 6 where 6 is the highest :
If the candidate's answer mentions has all the points that are present in the the expected correct answer set then assign his score is for 6
If the candidate's answer covers only half of the points specified in the the expected correct answer set then assign his score is for 3
If the candidate's answer covers lesser than half of the points specified in the the expected correct answer set then assign his score is for 1
If the candidate's answer covers none of the points specified in the the expected correct answer set then assign his score is for 0
After assigning the scores to each answer calculate the average. 
If the average is above is greater than 85% then can mark this candidate as shortlisted.
In you response mention the points that the candidate missed or incorrectly answered and finally in your concluding statement say if this candidate got shotlisted or not ?
